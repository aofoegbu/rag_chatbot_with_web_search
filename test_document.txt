Ogelo RAG Chat Assistant - Technical Documentation

Overview:
Ogelo RAG Chat Assistant is an advanced conversational AI system that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with document processing capabilities. The system allows users to upload documents and ask questions about their content, providing intelligent responses based on the uploaded knowledge base.

Key Features:
1. Document Upload and Processing
   - Supports text file uploads (.txt format)
   - Automatic text chunking for optimal retrieval
   - Vector embedding generation for semantic search

2. Intelligent Chat Interface
   - Natural language conversation capabilities
   - Context-aware responses using uploaded documents
   - Source citation for transparency

3. Knowledge Base Management
   - SQLite database for persistent storage
   - Document count tracking
   - Easy knowledge base clearing functionality

4. Adaptive Technology Stack
   - Primary: Advanced ML models (Phi-3-mini, sentence-transformers)
   - Fallback: Rule-based systems for basic functionality
   - Robust error handling and graceful degradation

Technical Architecture:
- Frontend: Streamlit web interface
- Backend: Python with modular components
- Database: SQLite for document storage
- Embeddings: Sentence transformers or simple text-based matching
- Language Model: Quantized Phi-3-mini or rule-based responses

Usage Instructions:
1. Upload a document using the sidebar file uploader
2. Click "Process Document" to add it to the knowledge base
3. Ask questions in the chat interface
4. Review sources provided with each response
5. Use "Clear Chat History" to start fresh conversations
6. Use "Clear Knowledge Base" to remove all documents

System Status Information:
The sidebar displays real-time status of system components, showing whether advanced ML models are available or if the system is running in fallback mode with simpler alternatives.

This system is designed to be resilient and functional even when some advanced dependencies are not available, ensuring users can always interact with their uploaded documents.
